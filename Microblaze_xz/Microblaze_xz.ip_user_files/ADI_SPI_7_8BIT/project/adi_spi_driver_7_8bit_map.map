Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                    89 out of  58,880    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                  89
  Number of Slice LUTs:                        133 out of  58,880    1%
    Number used as logic:                      131 out of  58,880    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              94
      Number using O5 output only:              32
      Number using O5 and O6:                    5
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:         2
  Number of route-thrus:                        34
    Number using O6 output only:                34

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    62 out of  14,720    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          158
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            69 out of     158   43%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  25 out of     158   15%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          64 out of     158   40%
    Number of unique control sets:               6
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               3 out of  58,880    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        42 out of     640    6%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      1 out of      32    3%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        1

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.23

Peak Memory Usage:  693 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  18 secs
